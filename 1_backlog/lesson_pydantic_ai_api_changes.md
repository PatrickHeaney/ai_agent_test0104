# Lesson Learned: Adapting to pydantic-ai API Evolution

## 1. Problem Summary

During the initial implementation of the AI agent, tests failed with a `TypeError`. The root cause was a significant change in the `pydantic-ai` library's API for initializing models and the agent itself. The reference examples and initial instructions were based on an older version of the library, leading to incorrect constructor arguments.

Specifically, the `OpenAIChatModel` no longer accepts `api_key` or `base_url` directly, and the `Agent` class expects a `model` object instead of an `llm` object.

## 2. Diagnostic and Resolution Steps

1.  **Initial Error**: The tests failed with `TypeError: OpenAIChatModel.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'api_key'`. This immediately indicated that the method signature for the model had changed.

2.  **Investigation**: By reviewing documentation and more recent examples, the new, correct pattern was identified. The library now separates the provider configuration (credentials, endpoint) from the model configuration (model name).

3.  **Solution**: The agent's initialization was refactored to use the `OpenAIProvider` class. This provider is configured with the API key and base URL, and then passed to the `OpenAIChatModel`. The resulting model object is then passed to the `Agent` constructor via the `model=` keyword argument.

## 3. Recommendations for Template Update

To prevent this issue in future projects, the template's core agent implementation (`agent.py`) must be updated to reflect the modern `pydantic-ai` API.

### Corrected `agent.py` Implementation

The following snippet shows the correct way to initialize the agent.

**REPLACE THIS (Old Pattern):**
```python
# In agent.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel

# ...

class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        llm = OpenAIChatModel(
            api_key=os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY"),
            base_url=os.getenv("LLM_BASE_URL"),
            model=os.getenv("LLM_CHOICE"),
        )
        self.agent = Agent(llm=llm)
```

**WITH THIS (New, Correct Pattern):**
```python
# In agent.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# ...

class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        llm_provider = OpenAIProvider(
            api_key=os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY"),
            base_url=os.getenv("LLM_BASE_URL"),
        )
        
        model = OpenAIChatModel(
            model_name=os.getenv("LLM_CHOICE"),
            provider=llm_provider,
        )

        self.agent = Agent(model=model)
```

By applying this change to the template, any new agent created from it will use the correct initialization pattern, avoiding these errors and ensuring compatibility with the current version of `pydantic-ai`.
